	Ms. Koch,
	
	 
	
	I am afraid that I will not be taking ExactTarget up on its offer this summer. I am really reluctant to say this, given how positive my experience was working there last summer and how many friends I made there. I'm sorry for delaying on this answer; my other offers have literally been trickling details to me. I have not made a final decision on competing offers, but I am 95% sure I will take Google up on their invitation to take part in the Freshman Engineering Practicum summer internship at their headquarters in Mountain View, CA. I want to give interning outside of the Indianapolis area a try, and this program looks like it will really help me establish the fundamentals as a freshman, to the point that I will feel more prepared to contribute to a program geared more toward upperclassmen like the Slingshot Program
	 
	 
	
	Please don't count me out for future internship/employment inquiries though. As I said, I can't forget how friendly and helpful my colleagues were to me last summer, and one of my best friends of 6 years works there. Furthermore, Indianapolis had been home for me for 19 years before college, and I had no particular inkling to leave behind such a welcoming city.
	 
	 
	
	Thank you again for the offer, and thank you for being so intentional about keeping up with me.
	
	
	
	Samuel Clarke
