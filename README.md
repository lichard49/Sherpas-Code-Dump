Sherpas-Code-Dump
=================
An Android application that helps victims of tragedies to be connected to lost belongings.  Written for the CS 2340 Design and Objects class at Georgia Tech, the application implements the Model-View-Presenter framework among many other design principles.  The class also required group collaboration, and this team consisted of 5 students that met at least weekly - and oftentimes, much more - to meet the milestones set by the professor.

The Android OS targeted was 4.0, and all source code was developed in Eclipse.  Graphics were produced with Photoshop.
